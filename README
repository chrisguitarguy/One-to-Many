One to Many
===========

A poor man's post to posts.

Overload WordPress' `post_parent` column for creating one to many (or many to
one, if you prefer) relationships.

Very light weight, but also very inflexible and not as full featured as something
like Posts 2 Posts.

Usage
-----

Register a new post type, but pass in the `otm_parent` argument which should
contain a string or array of post types which you want to to be "parents" of
the post type being registered.

    <?php
    /** Plugin Name: Some Plugin */
    add_action('init', function () {
        register_post_type('some_type', array(
            // other stuff here...
            // 'otm_parent'     => 'page',
            'otm_parent'    => array('post', 'page'),
        ));
    });
